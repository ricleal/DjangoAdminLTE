# TODO

## Remote

Remotes needs a facade and a superclass interface.
The idea is to have an interface with methods:
- start / stop transaction
- submit / query / stop job
Our code is for Moeba but users can use other services

## SANS

- Document the job submission: SANS create job using generic relations
- Create urls.py per instrument.
- See how to generate one script per reduction row.

Note:
Configuration 1-1 Reduction 1-N Entries

## Jobs

- Transaction can have many jobs
-
