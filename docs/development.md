# TODO

## Remote

Remotes needs a facade and a superclass interface.
The idea is to have an interface with methods:
- start / stop transaction
- submit / query / stop job
Our code is for Moeba but users can use other services

## SANS

- Document the job submission: SANS create job using generic relations

## Jobs

- Transaction can have many jobs
